Cerussa nativa was mentioned by Conrad Gessner in 1565, and in 1832 François Sulpice Beudant applied the name céruse to the mineral, while the present form, cerussite, is due to Wilhelm Karl Ritter von Haidinger in 1845. Miners' names for cerussite in early use were lead-spar and white-lead-ore. In a hydrate form known as white lead, the mineral is a key ingredient in lead paints and has also been used in cosmetics, but both uses are now discontinued in many places as a result of lead poisoning. These cerussite crystals, measuring approximately 4.0 cm × 3.0 cm × 2.0 cm (1.57 in × 1.18 in × 0.79 in), were found in a mine in Madan-e Nakhlak, Iran.\"\n",

            "3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .\n",
            "  This made for smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads, where the 750's display was more of a  jerky  movement .\n",
            "  I also found that the display on the 255w was a bit brighter, clearer, and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night .\n",
            "  The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .\n",
            "  The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .\n",
            " Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\n",
            " The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .\n",
            "  The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\n",
            "  The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\n",
            " The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .\n",
            " UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\n",
            "  I also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .\n",
            "  My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\n",

            "  Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\n",
            "  In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\n",
            "  The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\n",
            "  For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\n",
            " So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\n",
            "  It also can display and speak many languages .\n",
            "  I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\n",
            "  The display is great, and is very clear .\n",
            "  The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\n",
            "  The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\n",
            "  Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\n",
            "  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\n",
            "  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\n",
            "  I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :\n",
            "  But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .\n",
            "  Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .\n",
            "  I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\n",
            " The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .\n",
            "  I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\n",
            " ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\n",
            " The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .\n",
            "  Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\n",
            "  I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .\n",
            "  I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\n",
            "  Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .\n",
            " The Garmin has a nice 3d display .\n",
            " One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\n",
            "  I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .\n",
            "  I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .\n",

            "  The display is laid out better than the 660 .\n",
